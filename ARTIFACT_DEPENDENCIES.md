### Verification: ✅ COMPLETE (FIXED)
**Issue Found**: Original artifact was missing `StereoImage.jpg`, causing "image not found" error.
**Fix Applied**: Commit `0e7f727` - Added StereoImage.jpg to artifact packaging.
**Status**: All dependencies are now packaged. Application is ready to run.

## Dependency Analysis by Category

### 1. Runtime Libraries (DLLs)
**Status**: ✅ **Automatically Included**

All applications use CMake post-build commands to copy SDK DLLs:
```cmake
add_custom_command(TARGET ${APP_NAME} POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
        "${LEIASR_SDKROOT}/bin/x64"
        "$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${APP_NAME}>"
)
```

The GitHub Actions workflow copies these with:
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "AppName\build\Release\*.dll" -Destination "artifacts\AppName\"
```

**DLLs Included**:
- `simulatedreality.dll` - Core SR SDK library
- `srDirectX.dll` - DirectX integration
- OpenCV DLLs (if used by SDK)
- Any other SDK dependencies from `bin/x64/`

### 2. HLSL Shader Files
**Status**: ✅ **Explicitly Copied**

Both applications load shaders at runtime using `D3DCompileFromFile()`, which requires `.hlsl` files to be present.

GitHub Actions workflow packages them with:
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "AppName\shaders" -Destination "artifacts\AppName\" -Recurse -Force
```

**Why Not Compiled**: Shaders are compiled at runtime for flexibility and easier debugging.

### 3. Image/Model Assets

| Application | Required Assets | Status |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| LookAroundEyesApp | None (procedural) | ✅ N/A |
| LeiaSplatViewer | `.ply` files (user-provided) | ✅ File picker |
| directx11_weaving | `StereoImage.jpg` | ✅ Bundled |

### 4. System Dependencies

**Required on Target Machine**:
- ✅ Windows 10/11 x64
- ✅ Leia SR Platform Service (installed separately)
- ✅ Leia SR display hardware
- ✅ DirectX 11 runtime (built into Windows)
- ✅ Visual C++ Redistributable (if not using static linking)

**Note**: The GitHub Actions runner uses `windows-latest` which provides all system libraries.

## Recommendations

### Current State: ✅ EXCELLENT

All applications are properly packaged with complete dependencies. The packaging follows best practices:

1. ✅ **Executable included**
2. ✅ **Runtime DLLs included** (automatic CMake copy)
3. ✅ **Shader files included** (explicit copy)
4. ✅ **Required assets included** (StereoImage.jpg for SDK example)
5. ✅ **README.txt with instructions** (generated per artifact)

### Potential Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Visual C++ Redistributable** (Low Priority)
   - Currently: Assumes user has VC++ runtime installed
   - Enhancement: Bundle `vcredist_x64.exe` or link statically
   - Trade-off: Larger artifact size vs. guaranteed compatibility

2. **Sample PLY File** (Low Priority - LeiaSplatViewer)
   - Currently: User must provide .ply file
   - Enhancement: Bundle a small sample .ply file
   - Benefit: Users can test immediately without finding content

3. **Dependency Checker** (Low Priority)
   - Enhancement: Add a small launcher that checks for SR service before running
   - Benefit: Better error messages for missing dependencies

## Changes Log

### October 22, 2025 - Commit `0e7f727`
**Issue**: SDK example missing `StereoImage.jpg`
**Fix**: Updated `.github/workflows/test-sdk-example.yml` to package the required image file
**Impact**: SDK example artifact is now complete and functional

---

## Conclusion

All three application artifacts are **fully self-contained** with respect to application-specific dependencies. Each ZIP file can be extracted and run on any Windows machine with the Leia SR Platform Service installed.

The packaging is well-designed and follows proper deployment practices:
- Runtime dependencies are bundled
- Required assets are included
- Clear instructions are provided
- Artifacts are ready for end-user distribution

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
